Sure! Here’s a `README.md` file for your To-Do application that describes the model without including the schema definition.

# To-Do Application with Mongoose Model

## Overview

This is a To-Do application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose for data modeling. The application allows users to manage tasks, including uploading images, setting priorities, and due dates.

## To-Do Model

The To-Do model is designed to handle tasks with the following fields:

### Fields

- **title**: The title of the task (required).
- **desc**: A description of the task (required).
- **image**: URL or path to an associated image (required).
- **user**: Reference to the User model (required).
- **dueDate**: The due date for the task (required).
- **priority**: The priority level of the task, which can be "low", "medium", or "high" (required).

### Timestamps

The model automatically includes `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps for tracking when tasks are created and modified.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Set up MongoDB:**
